# React UI Component Library Starter Kit

This projects provides a set of common UI components that can built upon
for creating a custom component library for a React-based application.

## Installation

> `npm install`

## Starting the Storybook Documentation Site

> `npm run storybook`

By default, Storybook will run at `http://localhost:9009`.

## Creating a New Component

To create all files associated with a new component, run:

> `npm run plop`

You'll be prompted for a component name. All necessary files
will then be generated automatically.

## Global Styles

When importing components into your app, include the GlobalStyle component
in your root App component to ensure accurate styling:

```
import GlobalStyle from '../src/styles/global';

<App>
  <GlobalStyle />
  {children}
</App>
```
