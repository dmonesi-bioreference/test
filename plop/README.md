# Plop

We have a few generators that let you automate build-out of new components, and these are all defined and managed by Plop itself, the configuration of which resides at `plopfile.js`, and the templates in this directory under `plop/component/`.

To get started emitting a new component (really! give it a shot), use the command `yarn plop`.
