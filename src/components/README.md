# The components package

The components package contains generic, styled React components. The components here do not include any business logic. Components that do capture business logic live in `src/app/components`. A story file lives alongside the component file which captures the rendered state of the component. Components can then be visualised when Storybook starts, allowing for easier and faster development of isolated components.
